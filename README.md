## Hooks
  ### State Hooks 
  (Remember user information)
  * useState declares a state variable that you can update directly.
  * useReducer declares a state variable with the update logic inside a reducer function.
    
   ### Efect Hooks
   lets a component receive information from distant parents without passing it as props.
* useEffect connects a component to an external system. (it's executed when the screen or component is launched)
